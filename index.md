Greetings and welcome to my page. My name is Alvin and I love learning, teaching, and coding! I have a great passion for studying Computer Science at the UCSD where I am currently attending. I am interested in video game design and programming, as well as learning about the latest technologies that work for developers at both small-scale and large-scale studios. I am also interested in the graphic art and audio design involved in video gamed development. Some of my favorite games currently in order include:

1. Horizon Zero Dawn
2. Elden Ring
3. Guild Wars 2

Aside from video game development, I am also interested in computer science in education. Previously, I have worked as an instructor teaching robotics and computing concepts in a K-8 setting. I believe teaching students about computer science and computer technology at a young age is important for the development our future workforce. My hope is that we can help students see how learning to program can work for them. Just like reading, writing, and math, programming concepts are also often applicable in our everyday lives. I would like to see computer science becoming a core part of many educational curriculums in the near future, and if given the opportunity, I hope to be a part of such an exciting endeavour! If you would like to learn about computer science in K-12 education, UCSD's own Beth Simon has developed an [online course](k12.png) to learn all about that you can find [here](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/teach-impacts-technology-k12-education). 



Apart from my love for programming and computer education, some of my hobbies include music, exercise, and sports. I have a bit of background in writing and performing music, and nowadays I spend my spare time creating my own music with the help of Ableton. Some of my favorite music genres growing up include:

- Jazz
- Soul and Funk
- Hip-hop

My favorite form of exercise is runnning, about three times a week. I am training to up my pace for a 10k race towards the end of the year and my ultimate goal is to compete in half/full marathons in the near future. I am also an avid follower of NBA basketball. My favorite teams include the Golden State Warriors and Philadelphia 76ers. With the next season fast approaching, I hope to get tickets for a few games soon, go Sixers!
